        action: "RAG pipeline deep analysis"
        description: |
          Analyzed 6 areas of the RAG pipeline:
          1. Chunking strategy - found blind 400-char character splitting
          2. pgvector storage - found IVFFlat index wrong for small datasets
          3. Retrieval quality - no similarity threshold filtering
          4. Context size - only ~1,200 chars sent to Gemini (1M token capacity)
          5. Query flow - no text cleaning before embedding
          6. Improvement recommendations ranked by impact
        outcome: "Identified 5 critical issues to fix"

          - Added similarity_threshold=0.3 config
          - Switched pgvector index from IVFFlat to HNSW
          - Wired clean_text into upload pipeline
          - Added threshold filter in query endpoint

        action: "React UI redesign (dark → light theme)"
        description: |
          Redesigned the entire React frontend from dark theme to light theme
          matching the code.html reference design. No functionality changes.
          Design system: light bg (#f5f7f8), primary blue (#0d6cf2), Inter font,
          rounded cards, shadows, sticky header.
        files_changed:
          - RAG/index.html (added Inter font, updated title to SellBot AI)
          - RAG/src/index.css (light theme prose styles, scrollbar)
          - RAG/tailwind.config.js (light theme color tokens)
          - RAG/src/App.tsx (added header with logo, nav icons, avatar)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/Sidebar.tsx (white bg, blue active states)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx (hero empty state, FAQ cards, footer)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/InputBox.tsx (search bar style, shadow-xl)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx (light theme, blue user bubbles)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/UploadButton.tsx (added variant prop, light theme)
        additional_fixes:
          - Fixed constants.ts enum → const for erasableSyntaxOnly compatibility
          - Fixed SyntaxHighlighter ref type error in MessageBubble

          - 10 PDFs (property brochures, market report)
          - 2 XLSX (property comparison, price trends)
          - 2 DOCX (buying guide, amenities specification)
          - 1 multi-page PDF (Sunrise Heights, 4 pages)
          All saved to real_estate_documents/ folder.

        description: |
          Replaced raw HTTP error messages with user-friendly messages.
          Added getErrorMessage() function that maps status codes to
          natural language responses without technical jargon.
          Removed all mentions of "backend", "server", "status code".
        files_changed:

        action: "Fixed query phrasing sensitivity in retrieval"
        description: |
          User discovered that identical semantic queries returned different results:
          - "Give me the information about 3BHK Duplex" → no results
          - "What is the 3 BHK Duplex?" → correct answer
          Root cause: similarity_threshold was 0.5 (too strict) and no query normalization.
          Fixes applied:
          1. Lowered similarity_threshold from 0.5 → 0.15
          2. Added normalize_query() function to handle real estate shorthand
             (BHK spacing, sqft, Crores/Lakhs, Rs./INR variants)
          3. Improved "no results" message to guide user to rephrase or upload docs
          4. Increased top_k from 5 → 10 for wider retrieval net
          5. Improved system prompt to instruct LLM to read ALL chunks
        files_changed:
          - config.py (similarity_threshold 0.5 → 0.15, top_k 5 → 10)
          - app.py (added normalize_query, wired into /query endpoint)
        error_ref: "ERR_009, ERR_010"

          Created two educational documents explaining RAG internals:
          1. chunks_explained.md - What chunks are, how the pipeline creates them,
             why same document appears multiple times in sources, chunk overlap
          2. similarity_percentage_explained.md - What the match % means, how cosine
             similarity works, real scores from "Parking" query (49-58%), how top_k
             and threshold control what reaches the LLM
        files_created:
          - knowledge_base/chunks_explained.md

        description: |
          Upgraded the RAG system prompt in config.py with 9 instructions:
          1. Read ALL context chunks (fixes 3 BHK Duplex missed answer issue)
          2. Cite property names in answers (no more ambiguous "The price is...")
          3. Organize multi-property answers by property with bullet points
          4. Handle conflicting data from different sources
          5. Use markdown formatting (bold, bullets, tables)
          6. Be specific with numbers (exact prices, areas, counts)
          7. Prioritize higher relevance chunks
          8. No repetition across overlapping chunks
          9. Graceful "not found" response with guidance
          Also increased max_tokens from 1000 → 2048 for multi-property answers.
          Created prompt_engineering.md documenting why each instruction exists.
        files_changed:
          - config.py (system_prompt v2, max_tokens 1000 → 2048)
        files_created:
          - knowledge_base/prompt_engineering.md

        action: "Fixed upload button alignment in React UI"
        description: |
          User reported upload icon was below the input box instead of inline.
          Root cause: InputBox had disclaimer text inside its fragment, and flex
          container used items-end alignment.
          Fixes:
          1. Moved disclaimer text from InputBox to ChatWindow (outside flex row)
          2. Changed flex from items-end to items-center
          3. Added border-2 with blue hover effect to upload button
        files_changed:
          - RAG/src/components/chat/InputBox.tsx (removed disclaimer, just input div)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx (disclaimer moved here, items-center)
          - RAG/src/components/chat/UploadButton.tsx (border-2 + hover:border-primary)
